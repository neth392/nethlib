## Must be overridden to calculate & return the value to be set to an [Attribute]. The below
## attribute values (excluding [param effect_value]) are the current & not final values as
## this method is called during the calculation process of an [Attribute] before values are set
## to the attribute.
## [br][param attr_base_value] represents [method Attribute.get_base_value] at the current point
## in the calculation process. It does NOT represent the final value.
## [br][param attr_current_value] represents [method Attribute.get_current_value] at the current point
## in the calculation process. It does NOT represent the final value.
## [br][member effect_value] is the value derived from the [AttributeEffect].
